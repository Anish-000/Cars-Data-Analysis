🚗 Car Data Analysis using Python

This project focuses on analyzing car-related data using Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to clean, explore, and visualize the dataset to extract meaningful insights about different car attributes like price, mileage, fuel type, horsepower, and more.

🔍 Key Steps in the Project:

Data Loading & Cleaning: Importing the dataset (CSV) and handling missing, duplicate, or irrelevant values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using Pandas & NumPy for statistical summaries and correlations.

Data Visualization: Creating clear visualizations with Matplotlib & Seaborn (scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps, bar charts, etc.) to identify patterns and relationships.

Feature Insights: Understanding how different features (engine size, fuel type, brand, etc.) influence car pricing and performance.

📊 Tools & Libraries Used:

Pandas → Data manipulation & cleaning

NumPy → Numerical computations

Matplotlib → Data visualization

Seaborn → Statistical plots & heatmaps

🎯 Outcome:

By the end of this project, you will have a structured analysis of car data, with insights that can be used for market trends, consumer preferences, and predictive modeling in the automotive domain.
