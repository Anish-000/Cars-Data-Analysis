***🚗 Car Data Analysis using Python***

This project focuses on performing in-depth analytical processing on car-related datasets using Python and widely adopted data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The objective is to clean, explore, and visualize the dataset to derive meaningful insights about key automotive attributes such as price, mileage, fuel type, horsepower, and more.

***🔍 Key Steps in the Project***
1. Data Loading & Cleaning

Importing the dataset (CSV format) and performing preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, duplicate records, and filtering out irrelevant or noisy features.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Utilizing Pandas and NumPy for generating statistical summaries, descriptive metrics, and computing correlation structures between variables.

3. Data Visualization

Developing clear and insightful plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn (scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps, bar charts, etc.) to detect patterns, trends, and relationships across automobile features.

4. Feature Insights

Analyzing how specific attributes — such as engine displacement, fuel type, brand, and other key performance indicators — influence car pricing and overall performance metrics.

***📊 Tools & Libraries Used***

Pandas → Data manipulation & preprocessing

NumPy → Numerical computations

Matplotlib → Data visualization

Seaborn → Statistical and aesthetic plotting

***🎯 Outcome***

By the end of this project, you will have a structured, data-driven analysis of car attributes, enabling insights useful for identifying market trends, consumer preferences, and supporting predictive modeling within the automotive domain.
